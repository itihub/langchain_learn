LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.\\nWe recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous applications. Use LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.\\nLangChain agents are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.\\n\\u200b Create an agent\\nCopy# pip install -qU langchain \"langchain[anthropic]\"\\nfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\\n\\ndef get_weather(city: str) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Get weather for a given city.\"\"\"\\n    return f\"It\\'s always sunny in {city}!\"\\n\\nagent = create_agent(\\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\\n    tools=[get_weather],\\n    system_prompt=\"You are a helpful assistant\",\\n)\\n\\n# Run the agent\\nagent.invoke(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"what is the weather in sf\"}]}\\n)\\n\\nSee the Installation instructions and Quickstart guide to get started building your own agents and applications with LangChain.\\n\\u200b Core benefits\\nStandard model interfaceDifferent providers have unique APIs for interacting with models, including the format of responses.
